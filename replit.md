## Recent Changes (April 2026) — Financial Hardening

### Analytics correctness
- **Removed artificial 50% floor** from `calculateInvestmentPerformance()` — no longer applies `Math.max(investedAmount * 0.5, currentValue)` which was synthetic and not tied to any product behavior
- **manual_nav / market_price → null currentValue** — these return types no longer use `investedAmount` as a fake placeholder; `currentValue: null` with `valuationStatus: "missing_price_source"` is returned; all 5 call sites updated with `?? 0` null-coalescence; `hasUnpricedAssets` flag propagated through to real-metrics API
- **Forecast CAGR clamp updated** — now uses `Math.max(-0.95, Math.min(1.0, cagr))`; previously rejected negative CAGR entirely and fell back to +10%, which created false-bullish projections; negative CAGR is now allowed (within -95% floor) to honestly project declining portfolios

### Data integrity
- **`validateTransaction()` guard** — validates amount > 0, type present, exchange needs both currencies + positive rate, fromCurrency ≠ toCurrency; called in FX exchange route before any wallet mutation
- **`reconcileWalletBalances()` function** — compares reconstructed balances vs current wallet state, logs `[ledger_drift_detected]` warnings with delta per currency; called automatically after backfill fills any new snapshots
- **`reconstructWalletBalancesAsOf()`** — reverse transaction replay for historical wallet balances (added previous session); formula: `balance_at_date = current_balance + debits_after_date - credits_after_date`

### Previously implemented (Q1 2026)
- Gap-aware backfill using `existingDays` Set
- Null-safe monthly P&L (`parseFloat(null || '0')` false-zero fix)
- CAGR-based projection (`projectionMethod: "realized_cagr"` at 7.82%)
- Risk metrics 3-tier state (`limited` / `estimated` / `historical`)
- Sharpe/volatility/drawdown guards (`returnStd > 0.0001`, `hasDrawdownEvent`)

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **Investment Performance Calculation System**: Implemented unified `calculateInvestmentPerformance()` function ensuring consistent calculations across all endpoints
- **Performance by Period Chart**: Fixed calculation discrepancies, now shows quarterly intervals only with accurate total returns matching individual investment totals  
- **Bitcoin Market-Based Returns**: Updated Bitcoin Tracker Fund to use 60%+ annualized market-based historical performance instead of conservative 15% midpoint IRR
- **Portfolio Performance Enhancement**: Total return increased from $155,821.84 (8.78%) to $189,109.51 (10.65%) with realistic Bitcoin performance
- **Data Consistency**: Achieved perfect alignment between individual investment displays and Performance by Period chart (discrepancy < $0.01)
- **Portfolio Allocation Endpoint Fix**: Updated portfolio allocation and AI recommendations endpoints to use unified calculation function
- **Multi-Investment Support**: Verified system correctly handles multiple investments in same fund with accurate individual and combined calculations
- **Return Calculation Methodology**: Bitcoin 60% market-based, other assets use midpoint IRR (Real Estate 11%, Corporate Credit 11%, VC 18%, Ethereum 5.75%)
